libertine (0.99.8+16.04.20160114.1-0ubuntu1) xenial; urgency=medium

  [ Chris Townsend ]
  * Various fixes for making LXC containers work.
  * Refactor libertine-launch to have no explicit dependencies on
    either the LXC or chroot backends. Move specific functions to
    their respective backends.
  * Refactor the discovery of the type of container being used, so
    it's taken care inside of the class.
  * Add new libertine-launch tests.
  * Allow LXC containers access to /dev/dri devices since some X apps
    like to talk to them directly.
  * Fix Depends so that the lxc backend will be installed by default
    if the kernel supports it. Otherwise, fall back to the chroot
    backend.
  * As a temporary fix, disable seccomp when running proot. Fixes
    incompatible kernels. (LP: #1532856, #1532858)

  [ Stephen M. Webb ]
  * libertine-container-manager: added list-apps command
  * python/libertine/AppDiscovery.py: new module for app discovery

    a LXC.

  [ Łukasz 'sil2100' Zemczak ]
  * Add the puritine dummy click framework.

  [ Stephen M. Webb ]

    packages

libertine (0.99.4+16.04.20151023-0ubuntu1) xenial; urgency=medium

  [ Chris Townsend ]
  * Add a check to ensure the SUDO_UID and SUDO_GID keys exist in os.environ
    before actually trying to access them.
  * Switch to using the Python libertine-container-manager instead of the C++
    libertine_container_manager.  Simplifies code quite a bit. (LP: #1509472)
  * Fix the hard coded uid to read the actual uid when getting the dbus session
    address.
